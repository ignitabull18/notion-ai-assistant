## 🚦 Tips for Success

### Green Flags (You're Doing Great!)
✅ Describing what you want to achieve, not how
✅ Asking for suggestions and best practices
✅ Building incrementally on previous work
✅ Using natural, conversational language

### Red Flags (Try a Different Approach)
❌ Trying to use technical Notion terminology
❌ Asking for very specific property types
❌ Overthinking the request format
❌ Not providing enough context

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't know what to ask for"
Start with your pain points: "I always lose track of meeting notes" or "I need to see all my deadlines in one place"

### "The assistant didn't understand me"
Rephrase with more context: Instead of "Make it better", try "Add priority levels and due dates to the task database"

### "I want something very specific"
Break it down: First create the basic structure, then ask for specific modifications

## 🎁 Hidden Features

1. **Memory**: The assistant remembers your preferences and past conversations
2. **Patterns**: It learns your workspace patterns and suggests improvements
3. **Bulk Operations**: "Update all overdue tasks to high priority"
4. **Smart Suggestions**: Ask "What would make this database better?"
