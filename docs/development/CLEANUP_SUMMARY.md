# Cleanup Summary

## What Was Deleted:
1. ✅ `src/scheduler/` - ~1300 lines of custom scheduler code
2. ✅ `src/app/slack_utils.py` - ~300 lines of manual Slack utilities
3. ✅ Removed `openai`, `slack-sdk`, `pandas`, `aiohttp`, `sentence-transformers` from requirements.txt
4. ✅ Removed all custom caching decorators
5. ✅ Removed manual Slack verification code

## What Was Fixed:
1. ✅ `src/app/server.py` - Reduced from 400 lines to 48 lines
2. ✅ `src/agent/core.py` - Now uses proper Agno storage imports
3. ✅ `src/agent/integrations.py` - Reduced from 200+ lines to 39 lines
4. ✅ `requirements.txt` - Reduced to minimal dependencies

## What's Now Correct:
- FastAPI is just a thin wrapper (48 lines)
- SlackWebhookHandler handles ALL Slack logic
- ComposioTools handles ALL Slack/Notion operations
- Using agno.storage.sqlite.SqliteStorage (not custom)
- Using agno.models.litellm.LiteLLMOpenAI (not direct SDKs)
- No custom infrastructure code

## Next Steps:
1. Task 4: Implement pre-commit hooks to enforce rules
2. Complete Tasks 3 & 5 properly
3. Continue with remaining tasks using ONLY Agno built-ins
