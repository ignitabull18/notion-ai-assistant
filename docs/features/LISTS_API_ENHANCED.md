# Enhanced Slack Lists API Implementation

This document describes the comprehensive Lists API implementation for all three AI assistants. The Lists API enables creating and managing collaborative lists within Slack channels.

## Overview

The Slack Lists API (currently in development) allows apps to:
- Create structured lists with items, assignees, and due dates
- Update item status and properties
- Organize tasks, projects, and tracking items
- Integrate with external systems for synchronization

## Implementations

### Slack AI Assistant - General Lists
**Command**: `/ai-lists`

Features:
- **Templates**: Task lists, shopping lists, project checklists, goals tracker, event planning
- **Item Properties**: Text, assignee, due date, priority, status
- **Status Tracking**: Open, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled
- **Quick Actions**: Complete items, add items, view full list

Example:
```
/ai-lists create Team Sprint Tasks
/ai-lists add L12345 Review pull requests
/ai-lists show L12345
```

### Notion AI Assistant - Synced Lists
**Command**: `/notion-lists`

Features:
- **Notion Sync**: Lists automatically sync with Notion databases
- **Bi-directional Updates**: Changes in Slack update Notion and vice versa
- **Templates**: Project tasks, content calendar, OKRs tracker, bug tracker, reading list
- **Real-time Sync**: Configurable sync frequency (realtime, hourly, daily)
- **Field Mapping**: Map Slack list fields to Notion properties

Special Features:
- Creates Notion database when creating list
- Syncs status changes back to Notion
- Supports Notion-specific properties (select, multi-select, relations)

### Jungle Scout AI Assistant - Product Lists
**Command**: `/product-lists`

Features:
- **Product Watchlists**: Monitor ASINs for price/BSR changes
- **Research Checklists**: Structured product validation steps
- **Launch Checklists**: Product launch task tracking
- **Competitor Tracking**: Monitor multiple competitors
- **Alert System**: Notifications for threshold breaches

Templates:
- üëÅÔ∏è Product Watchlist - Price and BSR monitoring
- üîç Research Checklist - Market validation steps
- üöÄ Launch Checklist - Pre-launch to post-launch tasks
- üéØ Competitor Tracker - Monitor competition
- üì¶ Supplier Evaluation - Compare suppliers

## List Structure

### Basic List Object
```json
{
  "id": "L1234567890",
  "title": "Project Tasks",
  "channel": "C1234567890",
  "description": "Sprint 23 tasks",
  "emoji": "üìã",
  "color": "#4A90E2",
  "created": "2024-01-10T10:00:00Z",
  "items_count": 15
}
```

### List Item Object
```json
{
  "id": "LI1234567890",
  "list_id": "L1234567890",
  "text": "Complete user research",
  "status": "in_progress",
  "assignee": "U1234567890",
  "due_date": "2024-01-15",
  "priority": 3,
  "created": "2024-01-10T10:00:00Z",
  "completed_at": null,
  "completed_by": null
}
```

## Advanced Features

### 1. Smart Templates
Each assistant provides context-aware templates:
- Slack AI: General productivity templates
- Notion: Database-backed templates with schemas
- Jungle Scout: E-commerce specific workflows

### 2. Status Management
```python
class ListItemStatus(Enum):
    OPEN = "open"
    IN_PROGRESS = "in_progress"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    CANCELLED = "cancelled"
```

### 3. Priority System
- 5 = üî¥ Critical/High
- 3 = üü° Normal/Medium  
- 1 = üü¢ Low

### 4. Watchlist Alerts (Jungle Scout)
```python
alerts = {
    "price_drop": True,      # Alert on price decrease
    "bsr_improve": True,     # Alert on BSR improvement
    "new_reviews": False,    # Alert on new reviews
    "stock_low": False       # Alert on low stock
}
```

## UI Components

### List Display
- Header with emoji and title
- Items grouped by status
- Progress indicators
- Quick action buttons
- Context information (assignees, due dates)

### Interactive Elements
- ‚úì Complete buttons on open items
- Add item modal with full fields
- Settings and configuration
- Template selection interface

## Best Practices

### 1. List Organization
- Use descriptive titles and emojis
- Group related items in categories
- Set realistic due dates
- Assign items to team members

### 2. Status Updates
- Update status as work progresses
- Complete items promptly
- Use cancelled status instead of deleting

### 3. Integration
- For Notion: Map fields correctly
- For Products: Set appropriate thresholds
- For Tasks: Include priority levels

## Example Workflows

### Creating a Project Task List
```
1. /ai-lists templates
2. Click "Project Checklist"
3. List created with milestones
4. Team members complete tasks
5. Progress tracked automatically
```

### Setting up Product Monitoring
```
1. /product-lists create watchlist
2. Add ASINs with thresholds
3. Receive alerts on changes
4. Review competitor movements
5. Make informed decisions
```

### Syncing with Notion
```
1. /notion-lists create project
2. Notion database created
3. Add tasks in Slack
4. View/edit in Notion
5. Changes sync both ways
```

## Error Handling

Common issues and solutions:
- **list_not_found**: Verify list ID is correct
- **permission_denied**: Ensure bot has channel access
- **sync_failed**: Check Notion connection (Notion lists)
- **invalid_asin**: Verify product ID format (Jungle Scout)

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Recurring items support
- List sharing between channels
- Advanced filtering and search
- Bulk operations
- Export to CSV/Excel
- Mobile-optimized views
- Voice command support
- AI-powered task suggestions

## API Status Note

The Slack Lists API is currently in development. This implementation uses a combination of:
- Mock responses for demonstration
- Database storage for persistence
- Message-based UI for interaction
- Future-ready architecture for when the API launches

When the official API becomes available, the implementation can be updated to use native Slack Lists with minimal changes to the user interface.
